# AdaptiveCare AI

### The Healthcare Interface That Adapts to You in Real Time

AdaptiveCare AI is an adaptive healthcare dashboard designed to personalize the user interface for different healthcare users.

Instead of presenting the same fixed dashboard to everyone, the application changes its **layout density, typography, widget priority, navigation, and accessibility settings** based on the selected user persona and interface preferences.

The current prototype supports four adaptive experiences: **Senior Citizen, Diabetic Patient, Fitness Enthusiast, and Family Caregiver**.

</p>

---

### 🩸 Adaptive Dashboard — Diabetic Mode

Diabetic Mode prioritizes glucose-related information and daily health management.

Health trends, glucose information, and relevant tracking widgets are surfaced more prominently.

</p>

---

### Adaptive Dashboard — Fitness Mode

Fitness Mode uses a more detailed dashboard layout for users who want to view multiple performance metrics.

Activity information, heart-rate-related data, calorie progress, and fitness visualizations are given higher priority.

</p>

---

### Adaptive Dashboard — Caregiver Mode

Caregiver Mode focuses on health monitoring and oversight.

The dashboard provides a broader view of health information, medication-related data, and alerts relevant to a caregiver workflow.

</p>

---

### ⚙️ Customization Settings

Users can manually customize their interface instead of being restricted to the default persona configuration.

The settings interface supports changes to layout density, text sizing, and interface preferences.

##  The Problem

Healthcare users have different goals, abilities, and priorities, but many digital dashboards still rely on a fixed interface structure.

A senior citizen checking medications may need a simple interface with large text and clear actions. A diabetic patient may want glucose-related information to appear first. A fitness user may prefer a denser dashboard with multiple performance metrics. A caregiver may need a broader overview of health information.

Using the same layout for all of these users can create unnecessary complexity.

Some common interface challenges include:

- Dense dashboards that can be difficult to navigate
- Important information competing with less relevant widgets
- Limited typography and layout customization
- Generic navigation for users with different goals
- Emergency actions that may not be visually prioritized
- Interfaces designed around a single type of user

AdaptiveCare AI explores a simple idea:

> **What if the healthcare interface adapted to the user instead of expecting the user to adapt to the interface?**

---

##  The Solution

AdaptiveCare AI is a frontend prototype of an **adaptive healthcare dashboard**.

The application uses a shared component architecture and global application state to render different interface configurations for different user personas.

The adaptive experience can modify:

- Dashboard layout
- Layout density
- Typography scale
- Widget visibility and priority
- Navigation options
- Accessibility preferences
- Theme settings

The goal is not to build four separate healthcare applications.

Instead, AdaptiveCare AI uses **one interface system that can present different experiences based on the active user mode**.

---

## Four Adaptive Persona Modes

###  Senior Citizen Mode

Senior Mode is designed around simplicity and accessibility.

It prioritizes:

- Larger interface elements
- Clear navigation
- Emergency SOS access
- Medication information
- Doctor appointments
- Simplified health summaries

The interface reduces unnecessary visual density and keeps important actions visible.

---

### 🩸 Diabetic Patient Mode

Diabetic Mode focuses on daily health tracking.

It prioritizes:

- Glucose-related information
- Health trend visualization
- Medication tracking
- Daily monitoring widgets
- Relevant health metrics

The dashboard places condition-related information higher in the interface.

---

### ⚡ Fitness Enthusiast Mode

Fitness Mode provides a more information-dense experience.

It prioritizes:

- Fitness metrics
- Activity information
- Heart rate data
- Calorie progress
- Performance visualizations
- Detailed dashboard widgets

This mode is designed for users who prefer seeing multiple metrics at once.

---

### 🛡️ Family Caregiver Mode

Caregiver Mode focuses on monitoring and oversight.

It prioritizes:

- Health overview information
- Medication-related data
- Important alerts
- Care-related dashboard widgets
- Information relevant to monitoring workflows

The interface reorganizes dashboard content around caregiver-focused tasks.

---

## 🧠 How the Adaptive UI Works

AdaptiveCare AI uses a global application context to manage interface preferences and the currently active persona.

                        ▼
              Personalized Dashboard
```

The same application components are reused across persona modes.

The active configuration determines how the interface is presented to the user.

---

## 📐 Layout Density Engine

AdaptiveCare AI provides three dashboard density options.

### Simple

Simple mode creates a more spacious interface.

It uses larger spacing and card padding to reduce visual density and make dashboard sections easier to distinguish.

This mode is suitable for users who prefer a cleaner and less crowded interface.

### Balanced

Balanced mode provides a middle ground between spacing and information density.

It is designed for general dashboard usage and keeps important information visible without making the interface feel crowded.

### Detailed

Detailed mode reduces spacing between interface elements and allows more dashboard information to remain visible on the screen.

This mode is useful for users who prefer a data-rich experience.

The selected density affects dashboard spacing and card presentation across supported components.

---

## 🔤 Dynamic Typography Scaling

AdaptiveCare AI uses CSS custom properties with Tailwind CSS theme mappings to support global text scaling.

```css
@theme {
  --text-xs: var(--text-xs-scale, 0.75rem);
  --text-sm: var(--text-sm-scale, 0.875rem);
  --text-base: var(--text-base-scale, 1rem);
  --text-lg: var(--text-lg-scale, 1.125rem);
  --text-xl: var(--text-xl-scale, 1.25rem);
  --text-2xl: var(--text-2xl-scale, 1.5rem);
  --text-3xl: var(--text-3xl-scale, 1.875rem);
  --text-4xl: var(--text-4xl-scale, 2.25rem);
}
```

When the text scale changes, the application applies the corresponding font scale configuration at the root interface level.

Supported scale modes include:

- Small
- Medium
- Large
- Extra Large

Components using the mapped typography variables inherit the updated scale, allowing text sizing to change consistently across the interface.
